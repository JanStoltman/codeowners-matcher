# CODEOWNERS matcher
This repository contains a simple kotlin CODEOWNERS matcher that can be used to match a file path to a list of GitHub [CODEOWNERS](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/about-code-owners#codeowners-syntax).
Given a file path, and the CODEOWNERS file it'll return a list of owners matching the file path. 

## Usage
Just copy the matcher and use it in your project. If there's interest in this library, let me know and I'll publish it as an artifact.
